## Facial Recognition Attendance System

The Facial Recognition Attendance System is a desktop application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It serves as an efficient solution for managing attendance records by employing facial recognition technology to identify students. The system matches the captured facial images with the database of registered students and updates their attendance automatically.

## Features

- Robust facial recognition algorithm for accurate identification.
- User-friendly GUI developed with Tkinter.
- Ability to add, update, delete, and search student records.
- Input validation for mandatory fields.
- Display of student records in a tabular format.
- Integration with MySQL database for storing student information and attendance records.
- Real-time video streaming for capturing facial images.
- Automated attendance updating based on facial matches.


## Usage

1. Launch the application by running the main.py script.
2. Register students by providing their details and capturing their facial images.
3. Use the "Attendance" button to initiate the attendance capturing process.
4. The system will match the captured facial images with the database and update attendance accordingly.
5. View attendance records and student details in the provided interface.

## Dependencies

- Tkinter
- OpenCV
- MySQL Connector
